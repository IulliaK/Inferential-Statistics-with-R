This repository showcases my past projects in Inferential Statistics unsing R. Current content:
1. [Data Analysis Project - Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW)](https://github.com/IulliaK/InferentialStat.r/blob/main/Causal%20Inference%20-%20IPTW.pdf).
2. [Data Analysis Project - Analyse Data in R using Propensity Score Matching.](https://github.com/IulliaK/InferentialStat.r/blob/main/Propensity%20score%20matching.pdf).

Both projects were conducted in R and later rendered as pdf files.
